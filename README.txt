Contact form that answers your users emails directly on the page. 

== Description ==
The idea with Answering Contact Form came after we realised that we spend multiple hours a day answering the same emails over and over again. Hours that could be spent on more importent things, like actually building your business.
<br>
Answering Contact Form will not only reduce emails in your inbox but also give your customers the best possible service. If they do not like the automatic answer that the form provides, they can still send the email. Answering Contact Form is a win-win!
<br>
How does it work?<br>
Every time a visitor sends an email from Answering Contact Form, the form matches the e-mail content with all the questions and answers that you have added to the plugins database. If the contact form finds a question that is similair to the email content, it displays the question with the answer. The user can then decide if they're happy with the answer or still want to send the email. If there's no similair question in the database, the contact form sends the email as usual.
